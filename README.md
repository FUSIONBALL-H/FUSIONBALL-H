- 👋 Hi, I’m @FUSIONBALL-H. I'm an ex-lawyer that should have been a computer programmer but got my degree in music theory* instead. (*I call it my degree in Beethoven Studies, well, because...)
- 👀 I also was trained in the US securities industry as a broker/dealer but finance is overweight its share of malefactors/rug-pullers/bad guys. The truth of the blockchain is their worst nightmare :)
- 🌱 I was introduced to the Cosmos ecosystem in 2019 (with Akash) and have never looked back. It has been a pleasure to meet so many focused individuals who share a great deal of my personal values. What a rush!
- 💞️ I'm constantly on the edge of my seat as these technologies develop right in front of my eyes...it is a good time to be alive! 
     I currently provide liquidity for the Osmosis DEX and am bringing a few close friends along for the ride. I'm looking for ways to further utilize my Cosmos and other resources to help grow the community. I don't have a programming background but I learn what I need to do what must be done.
- 📫I'm happy to collaborate/provide feedback for any project that is useful.
